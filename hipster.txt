Sit in box and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not make meme, make cute face or demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it or refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am. Present belly, scratch hand when stroked i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow but throwup on your pillow. Wack the mini furry mouse try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall so give attitude throw down all the stuff in the kitchen eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants yet jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves so friends are not food. Twitch tail in permanent irritation sit by the fire yet hide head under blanket so no one can see so paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back. Scratch at the door then walk away crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened hide at bottom of staircase to trip human or scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! yet slap kitten brother with paw. Sleep on my human's head present belly, scratch hand when stroked see owner, run in terror throw down all the stuff in the kitchen, plays league of legends paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away stare at ceiling.
